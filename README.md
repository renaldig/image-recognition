# Image Recognition with CIFAR-10 Dataset on Amazon SageMaker

This project demonstrates how to train and deploy an image classification model on Amazon SageMaker using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

1. Fetching and converting the CIFAR-10 dataset to RecordIO format.
2. Uploading the training and validation data to Amazon S3.
3. Training an image classification model using the SageMaker built-in image classification algorithm.
4. Deploying the trained model to an endpoint.
5. Making predictions using the deployed model.
6. Cleaning up the resources.

## Requirements
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account
- SageMaker Instance
- CIFAR-10 dataset

## Setup and Running
1. Open your AWS account and create a SageMaker instance.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook environment and upload the provided notebook.
3. Run all the code that is in the notebook.
